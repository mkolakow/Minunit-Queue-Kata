The goal of this repository is to make readily available the Minunit Queue Kata source and documentation.

Q: What are milestones?

A: Well, this kata is fairly complex.  So, we are attempting to break it into chunks that
   can be digested.  A milestone is what, to us, feels like a good stopping point.  Here,
   you can compare your code to what is in the milestone or even check one out.

   In fact, if you have mastered a particular milestone, you can start there as opposed
   to the very beginning.  After all, the Minunit Queue Kata is probably at least an 
   hour long.


Q: Where do I get the documentation?

A: The best place will be these two google docs:
